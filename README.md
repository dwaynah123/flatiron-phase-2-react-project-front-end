# Project Name: My Digital Diary

My Flatiron Phase 2 Project is a single page API that you use as your own personal diary. This api will help with organzing your thoughts and help you vent your troubles. You put your name and diary entry then it gets posted on the page. I created this API using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, React, JSX, Developer tools, Github, and Visual Studio Code.

## How to Use

Once the page loads you should see the home page. It welcomes you to the page.Next you press the Post button at the top and that is where you will be able to type your journal entries. All your entries get saved on your page.
